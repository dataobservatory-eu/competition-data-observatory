**Every day, thousands of new datasets become available via the EU open data regime, freedom of information legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions, or open science and scientific reproducibility requirements.**

These datasets are usually very reliable, high value datasets, and their cumulative estimated value is close to 100 billion euros in the EU alone. But they offer no free lunch: originally collected to evaluate policies, measure inflation, control tax returns, or predict the weather or traffic jams, they typically require a thorough reprocessing for reuse in the music industry or another new context. Our software solutions automate this process: for example, whenever price data is collected to measure inflation in EU countries, we automatically extract the price data relevant to cultural products.

The creative and cultural industries often do not participate in government statistics programs because these industries are typically comprised of microenterprises that are exempted from statistical reporting and that file only simplified financial statements and tax returns. In the creative and cultural sector, industry-organized data collection is particularly important. We map all important global and European data collection, and we often carry out primary data collection for European stakeholders. With the necessary permissions from data owners, these datasets can often be shared and accessed on a continuous, automated basis is similarly possible (after the necessary approvals of data owners), similar to open data, open science, or freedom-of-information sources.

## European open data

The European data regulation uses the expression `open data`  for anonymized or non-confidential data that has been collected by a public sector organization. Such data is usually openly available for reuse.

While reusable public sector information (often covered in other jurisdictions by freedom of information, or *FOI*, legislation) is free or requires only a marginal cost reimbursement, it is usually not directly usable. The data was collected and processed to meet the needs of a primary use, such as tax administration or short-term meteorological forecasting, or to understand current public opinion about a policy proposal. To make use of the information content, the data usually must undergo reprocessing, normalization, translation in terms of units and currency, and various other processing steps that must be carried out without error.

## Open Science

First class scientific journals often require the publication of empirical or other data that supports published scientific claims. This means that a large quantity of the data input into the world’s highest level scientific output is freely available. Similarly to reusable public sector data, these datasets are high quality and affordable or free to access --- but were collected to meet the needs of the original scientific inquiry. Thus, the data usually requires the same steps of reprocessing as re-used public sector information.

## Survey harmonization {#retroharmonize}

In economics and social sciences, market research, politics, and policy design, surveys are often the primary sources of information. Online, telephone, and in-person interviews are transcribed into various datasets that are, in the case of public sector or scientific research, typically available for free reuse.
The cost of conducting surveys has exploded, and due to the increasing number of short online surveys, the general public suffers survey fatigue. The cost of a high quality survey that represents the general population of consumers, voters, or citizens of the European Union is around a million euros; even national or regional surveys are often outside of the reach of smaller organizations.

Our solution to this is software supported retrospective survey harmonization. We locate previous surveys where your question has already been asked, and create accompanying surveys that show change over time or more specific details. Survey harmonization allows comparison across nations, within regions, or over time, and can significantly reduce the costs of conducting high quality survey research.

We also syndicate surveys. Our surveys of music professionals, for example, ask harmonized questions across a growing number of countries’ populations of music professionals, allowing a comparison of music economics since 2014.
