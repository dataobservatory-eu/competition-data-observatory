## Advantages of reproducible research

* Improves work habits and enhances the efficiency of analysts.
Increases teamwork and facilitates training, substitution, and handover between team members.
* Avoids duplication and multiplication of efforts. Dramatically reduces the time spent on data manipulation and debugging, error searching, and formatting. This can save up to 80% of working time in analyst and consultant roles.
Increases efficiency of senior staff oversight, as most errors are captured automatically.
* Facilitates cumulative growth of data, information, and knowledge. In the medium run it reduces data and information costs significantly, and over the long run it produces a very strong competitive edge.
* Replication, reproducibility, and the higher standards of confirmability and auditability are not only scientific standards, but they are often set by market regulators, professional standards and internal working guidelines. These are far easier to achieve with automation.
* Provides access to the growing body of open data in the EU (such as survey data, raw data used to calculate inflation, etc.), which is as raw data free or almost free, but creates large processing costs, as it is offered by public bodies on an as-is basis. This can replace costlier and less valuable data acquisitions.

## Our Software Solutions

Our reproducible research solutions go through rigorous unit-testing and anonymous peer review before release. They are fully open source and their use requires no unforeseen costs or vendor lock-in. You are even free to modify the software as long as you do not sell our product as commercial software.

[iotables](/software/iotables/) is a reproducible research tool that is able to work with national accounts and create some satellite accounts for all EU member states. It was originally developed to calculate the economic impacts of the Hungarian tax shelter before renewal (state aid notification at DG Competition) and for the Slovak Music Industry Report, which used similar methodology to prove that the cultural and creative sectors are overtaxed in the country. The [iotables] open-source statistical software library is used by about 800 practitioners in the world.

[regions](/software/regions/) solves the problems caused by Europe’s shifting regional boundaries, which have undergone changes in several thousand places over the last twenty years, meaning  member states’ and Eurostat’s regional statistics are not comparable over more than two to three years. This software validates and, where possible, changes the regional coding from NUTS1999 until the not yet used NUTS2021, opening up vast, valuable, untapped data sources that can be used for longitudinal analysis or for panel analysis far more precise than what  national data alone would allow. It was originally designed in a research project at IVIR in the University of Amsterdam to understand the geographical dynamics of book piracy. Because of the needs this software fills, it had 700 users in the first month after publication.

[retorhamonize](/software/iotables/) s a software that allows the programmatic retrospective harmonization of surveys, such as the last 35 years of all Eurobarometer microdata, or all Afrobarometer microdata. Eurobarometer grew out of certain CEE member states’ need for comparable data about their music and audiovisual sectors. We commissioned surveys following ESSNet-Culture guidelines and combined our survey data with open access European microdata-level surveys.
