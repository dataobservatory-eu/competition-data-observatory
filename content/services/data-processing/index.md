title: Data Processing
summary: Data analysts spend 80% of their time on data processing, even though computers can perform these task much faster, with far less errors, and they can document the process automatically. Data processing can be shared: an analyst in a company and an analyst in an NGO does not have to reprocess the very same data twice.
