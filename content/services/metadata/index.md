title: Metadata
summary: We follow the ethical guidelines set up the by the European Union for trustworthy AI that is transparent, validated, and free of discrimination.  We create ethical recommendation systems or help the validation and assessment of third-party systems to avoid undetected biases. We believe that AI-driven sales bots should comply with competition and consumer protection rules just like the human salesforce.

In the \@ref(FAIR-data). [FAIR Data and the Added Value of Rich Metadata](#FAIR-data) we introduce how we apply the concept of [FAIR](#FAIR) (**f**indable, **a**ccessibe, **i**nteroperable, and **r**eusable digital assets) in our APIs. 

Metadata gets less attention than data, because it is never acquired separately, it is not on the invoice, and therefore it remains an 

does not relate to material data acquistion costs, but in fact, it is even more important: it is responsible for industry non-billable hours or uncredited working hours in academia. Poor data documentation, lack of reproducible processing and testing logs, inconsistent use of currencies, keywords, and storing [messy data](#messy-data) make reusability impossible. Organizations pay many times for the same, repeated work, because these boring tasks, which often comprise of tens of thousands of microtasks, are neglected. Our solution creates automatic documentation and metadata for your own historical internal data or for acquisitions from data vendors. We apply the more general [Dublin Core](#Dublin-Core) and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of [DataCite](#DataCite) for datasets -- these are new requirements in EU-funded research from 2021. But they are just the minimal steps, and there is a lot more to do to create a diamond ring from an uncut gem.
