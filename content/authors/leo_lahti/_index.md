Leo Lahti is associate professor in data science at the University of Turku, and co-founder of [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.org), an open developer network that generates reproducible research tools for open government data analytics in R. The twenty years of work experience in data-intensive applications of computational and data sciences and machine learning, ranging from natural sciences to the humanities, help to bridge the gap between the theory and applications in quantitative research.
